<p>Swift AI is a high-performance deep learning library written entirely in Swift. We currently offer support for all Apple platforms, with Linux support coming soon.</p>
<h2>Tools</h2>
<p>Swift AI includes a collection of common tools used for artificial intelligence and scientific applications:</p>
<ul>
<li>[x] <a href="https://github.com/Swift-AI/NeuralNet">NeuralNet</a><ul>
<li>A flexible, fully-connected neural network with support for deep learning</li>
<li>Optimized specifically for Apple hardware, using advanced parallel processing techniques</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>[ ] Convolutional Neural Network</li>
<li>[ ] Recurrent Neural Network</li>
<li>[ ] Genetic Algorithm Library</li>
<li>[ ] Fast Linear Algebra Library</li>
<li>[ ] Signal Processing Library</li>
</ul>
<h2>Example Projects</h2>
<p>We've created some example projects to demonstrate the usage of Swift AI. Each resides in their own repository and can be built with little or no configuration:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Swift-AI/NeuralNet-MNIST">NeuralNet-MNIST</a><ul>
<li>A <a href="https://github.com/Swift-AI/NeuralNet">NeuralNet</a> training example for the <a href="http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/">MNIST</a> handwriting database</li>
<li>Trains a neural network to recognize handwritten digits</li>
<li>Built for macOS</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Swift-AI/NeuralNet-Handwriting-iOS">NeuralNet-Handwriting-iOS</a><ul>
<li>A demo for handwriting recognition using <a href="https://github.com/Swift-AI/NeuralNet">NeuralNet</a></li>
<li>Pre-trained; just download and run</li>
<li>Built for iOS</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Each module now contains its own documentation. We recommend that you read the docs carefully for detailed instructions on using the various components of Swift AI.</p>
<p>The example projects are another great resource for seeing real-world usage of these tools.</p>
<h2>Compatibility</h2>
<p>Swift AI currently depends on Apple's <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Accelerate/Reference/AccelerateFWRef/">Accelerate</a> framework for vector/matrix calculations and digital signal processing.</p>
<p>In order to provide support for more platforms, alternative BLAS solutions are being considered.</p>
<h2>Contributing</h2>
<p>Contributions to the project are welcome. We simply ask that you strive to maintain consistency with the structure and formatting of existing code.</p>
