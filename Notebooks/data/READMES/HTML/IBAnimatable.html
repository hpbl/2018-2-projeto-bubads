<p><strong>The app was made in Interface Builder with <code>IBAnimatable</code> without a single line of code</strong>. Due to the size of <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2453933-IBAnimatable-Design-App-Store-ready-Apps-in-Interface-Builder">the GIF file on Dribbble</a>, it only demonstrates a subset of features. We can also find the full HD version on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvD8X6J1YLM">YouTube</a> or <a href="https://github.com/IBAnimatable/IBAnimatable-Misc/blob/master/Videos/IBAnimatable.mp4?raw=true">MP4 on Github</a></p>

<p><img alt="StoryboardPreview" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBAnimatable/IBAnimatable-Misc/master/IBAnimatable/Storyboard.jpg" /></p>
<p>Here is the full design in a Storyboard in Interface Builder.</p>
<p>With <code>IBAnimatable</code>, we can design a UI in Interface Builder like what we can do in Sketch, and prototype animations in a Swift playground like what we can do in Framer. Also, we can use the output of the design directly in the production ready App.</p>
<p>As a designer, we love Sketch, which is a simple but yet super powerful tool to create UI. However, Sketch can't design interaction, navigation, transition and animation, and we may need another tool like Framer to design some of them. Moreover, to make an App Store ready App, we need to use Xcode and Interface Builder to implement the UI and animations. To speed up the process and minimize the waste, we create <code>IBAnimatable</code> to make Interface Builder designable and animatable.   </p>
<h2>How to install</h2>
<h3>Manually install</h3>
<p>Copy and paste <code>IBAnimatable</code> folder in your Xcode project.</p>
<h3><a href="https://swift.org/package-manager">Swift package manager</a></h3>
<p>To integrate using Apple's Swift package manager, add the following as a dependency to your <code>Package.swift</code>:</p>
<p><code>swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/IBAnimatable/IBAnimatable.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "5.0.0"))</code></p>
<h3><a href="https://cocoapods.org">CocoaPods</a></h3>
<p>Add the following entry in your Podfile:</p>
<p><code>ruby
   pod 'IBAnimatable'</code></p>
<h3><a href="https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage">Carthage</a></h3>
<p>Add the following entry in your Cartfile:</p>
<p><code>github "IBAnimatable/IBAnimatable"</code></p>
<p>Please Notice, there is <a href="https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/issues/335">a limitation of a built framework for <code>@IBDesignable</code> and <code>@IBInspectable</code></a>, that will impact on <code>IBAnimatable</code> when you use Carthage. There is a workaround to use Carthage or Swift package manager with <code>IBAnimatable</code>, please have a look at <a href="https://github.com/IBAnimatable/IBAnimatable/issues/354">Carthage – no Animatable UI Classes appearing in Storyboard</a></p>
<p>As @DanielAsher mentioned</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I use carthage update --use-submodules --no-build --no-use-binaries and manually add the both the framework project and the framework as an embedded dependency.
This method is robust, and fine-grained, but perhaps not as easy as dragging the built framework into your project.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Git submodule</h3>
<p>Add this repo as a submodule, and add the project file to your workspace. You can then link against <code>IBAnimatable.framework</code> for your application target. </p>

<h2>Languages</h2>
<p><a href="Documentation/README.zh.md">中文</a></p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>From prototype to shippable App Store ready App - What you design in Interface Builder is what the App exactly looks. More details can be found in this talk <a href="https://youtu.be/HaB2_ki_67w">Prototype and Design App Store ready Apps in Interface Builder (/dev/world/2016)</a></li>
<li>Designer-friendly - Sketch style configuration panel on Attributes inspector (<img alt="Attributes inspector" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBAnimatable/IBAnimatable-Misc/master/IBAnimatable/AttributesInspector.png" />) to lower the learning curve for using Interface Builder.   </li>
<li>Animation design support in Swift playground - Similar to Framer, we can prototype animations in Swift playground to save time for running on a simulator or actual iOS devices. </li>
<li>Built-in Auto Layout support - We can use Auto Layout and Size Classes with <code>IBAnimatable</code> to support orientations and multiple iOS devices. </li>
<li>Navigation and transition support - We can use default navigation pattern in the App. <code>IBAnimatable</code> also has custom transition animators and segues to support transition animations and gesture interactions.</li>
<li>Protocol-oriented programming - <code>IBAnimatable</code> uses a protocol-oriented programming paradigm. With Swift protocol extension, it is easy to support more designable or animatable features. We can even use these protocol extensions to create other custom UI elements instead of using the default ones from <code>IBAnimatable</code>. More details can be found in this talk <a href="https://youtu.be/HaB2_ki_67w?t=24m13s">Prototype and Design App Store ready Apps in Interface Builder (/dev/world/2016) - Part 2: Protocol oriented programming</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Use cases</h2>
<ul>
<li>Prototyping - Create interactive prototypes to validate ideas quickly.</li>
<li>Redesigning in Interface Builder - Redesign the UI from Sketch and animations from Framer without writing any code.</li>
<li>Making custom UI elements - Use <code>IBAnimatable</code> protocols to make custom UI elements. e.g. Buttons with a default color palette.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to run the example App</h2>
<p>The easy way to learn and understand how powerful of <code>IBAnimatable</code>is to run the example App and play around the settings in Interface Builder. Just a few steps we can run the App as below, to see more features, we can tap on "Forget Password" button to unlock them. 😉</p>
<p>1) Clone the repository</p>
<p><code>bash
$ git clone https://github.com/IBAnimatable/IBAnimatable.git</code></p>
<p>2) Open the workspace in Xcode</p>
<p><code>bash
$ cd IBAnimatable
$ open IBAnimatable.xcworkspace</code></p>
<p>3) Compile and run the app on your simulator or iOS device</p>
<h2>How to design in Interface Builder</h2>
<p><img alt="" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBAnimatable/IBAnimatable-Misc/master/IBAnimatable/DesignInInterfaceBuilder.png" /></p>
<p>To use <code>IBAnimatable</code> to design the UI and animations in Interface Builder, just follow a few steps as below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open a Storyboard or Xib file.</li>
<li>Drag and drop a UIKit element e.g. <code>UIView</code> to a <code>UIViewController</code>.</li>
<li>In Identity inspector (<img alt="Identity inspector" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBAnimatable/IBAnimatable-Misc/master/IBAnimatable/IdentityInspector.png" />), configure the UI element to <code>Animatable</code> custom UI class e.g. <code>AnimatableView</code>, you can find all <code>Animatable</code> classes in <a href="Documentation/APIs.md">APIs.md</a>.</li>
<li>Configure the UI and animations in Attribute Inspector.</li>
</ol>
<h2>How to animate in Swift playground</h2>
<p><img alt="" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBAnimatable/IBAnimatable-Misc/master/IBAnimatable/AnimateInSwiftPlayground.gif" /></p>
<p>We can configure the animation settings in Attribute inspector. However, Interface Builder doesn't support previewing Animations, but we can still prototype animations in Swift playground. There are three sample pages to demonstrate how to design animation in Swift playground. You can find them in <a href="IBAnimatable.playground">IBAnimatable.playground</a>. </p>
<ol>
<li>Open IBAnimatable.xcworkspace</li>
<li>Select IBAnimatable Framework scheme and build it with <code>Command + b</code></li>
<li>Select IBAnimatable.playground, choose one page in Swift playground, then click on "Assistant editor" button to split the playground. After that, select "Timeline" on the top of right-hand side to preview the animation. We can use Xcode menu "Editor" -&gt; "Execute" to re-run the playground.</li>
</ol>
<h2>How to animate programmatically</h2>
<p>As you saw above, we can prototype an App fully in Interface Builder without a single line of code, but <code>IBAnimatable</code> also provides APIs to let us fully control the UI and animations. <code>IBAnimatable</code> provides simple promise-like APIs. We can easily call them in one line.</p>
<p><code>swift
view.animate(.pop(repeatCount: 1)) // pop animation for the view
view.animate(.squeezeFade(way: .in, direction: .left)) // squeeze and fade in from left animation</code>  </p>
<p>You can play around with all these predefined animations in the <a href="IBAnimatable.playground/Pages/Predefined%20Animations.xcplaygroundpage">Swift playground Page - Predefined Animations</a></p>
<h3>Animation properties</h3>
<p>There are some properties we can change to customize the animation. What we need to do is to pass the parameters to <code>animate()</code> method to start the animation.</p>
<p><code>swift
view.animate(.squeeze(way: .in, direction: .left), duration: 1, damping: 1, velocity: 2, force: 1)</code></p>
<p>You can play around with all animations with different parameters in the <a href="IBAnimatable.playground/Pages/Animation%20Properties.xcplaygroundpage">Swift playground Page - Animation Properties</a></p>
<h3>Chaining animations</h3>
<p>Sometimes, we need to run more animation after the previous one. With <code>IBAnimatable</code>, we can easily use promise-like API to chain all animations together to provide a sleek user experience.</p>
<p><code>swift
// We can chain the animations together, it is the source code of animated GIF in "Animate in Swift playground" section
view.animate(.squeezeFade(way: .in, direction: .down))
    .then(.pop(repeatCount: 1))
    .then(.shake(repeatCount: 1))
    .then(.squeeze(way: .in, direction: .down))
    .then(.wobble(repeatCount: 1))
    .then(.flip(along: .x))
    .then(.flip(along: .y))
    .then(.slideFade(way: .out, direction: .down))</code></p>
<h3>Delaying animations</h3>
<p>We can use <code>delay</code> method to delay the next animation.</p>
<p><code>swift
view.animate(.squeeze(way: .in, direction: .left))
    .delay(0.5)
    .then(.shake(repeatCount: 3))</code></p>
<p>We can also delay the first animation.</p>
<p><code>swift
view.delay(2)
    .then(.squeeze(way: .in, direction: .left))</code></p>
<h3>Completion handler</h3>
<p>We can add a completion handler/closure to execute when all animations are completed.</p>
<p><code>swift
view.animate(.squeeze(way: .in, direction: .left))
    .completion { print("Animations finished!") }</code></p>
